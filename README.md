# Sorting Algorithms
Repository for playing with algorithms:

Ideas:
- Compare how algorithms perform with big/small input sets.
- Add more sorting algorithms.
- Make it possible to test algoriths with huge amounts of data (like a million records).
- Add Java8 features to code.
- Add a GUI or make it possible with command line parameters to control application instead of hard coded tests in PersonSorter class.
